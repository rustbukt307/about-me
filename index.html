    		<h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
    			<p>I grew up in a little town called Great Meadows, New Jersey where I've lived since my early childhood starting back in 1990. Located in the northwestern edge of the state the town sits upon a mountain and has no shortage of gorgeous views, long winding roads, and local charm. I spent my childhood exploring the vast wooded areas near my home having countless adventures and discovering various treasures and secrets that I would often share with my cousins who lived nearby as well as my younger brother. We were inseperably close and did nearly everything together especially during the summer months and holiday seasons. It was during this time that we were often looked after by our grandparents while our parents worked fulltime jobs during the day.</p>
    			<p>Since then I've studied fine arts in high school and my first couple semesters of college. During my time in undergrad I discovered my campus' radio station and became completely enamored with the idea of being a DJ. I decided to switch my major to communications and immediately signed up to host a show. Paired up with two of my good college friends, we put on a show called "Three Hours 'til Midnight" where we played our favorite heavy metal artists beginning at 9PM without stopping until the stroke of midnight. Sadly my radio career ended there as jobs in the field after graduation were nearly nonexistent. After fumbling around in odd jobs for far too long I decided to jump into the world of automotive retail where I worked for nearly eight years at various establishments. I did everything from scheduling appointments, taking online inquiries, sales, and finishing up my time as a technology expert for new vehicle deliveries. It was a time I'll always remember but as far as longevity goes, I've found the industry too unstable as constant lay-offs and changes in ownership ran rampant during my tenue in the business.</p>
    		<h3>Hobbies, Interests, and Passions</h3>
    			<p>My favorite part, the things that inspire me day to day and fuel my creativity. I have a deep-rooted love for anything automotive and spent my childhood dreaming of the day when I would have my own set of wheels. You'll typically find me at most Cars'n Coffee events in the tri-state area where I love to take photos of the cars on display. I'll typically spend the morning before painstakingly washing and detailing my vintage Cadillac in preparation for the event. As much as I love old cars over their modern day counterparts, they are not without their tempermental moments. Whenever this is the case, I'm never hesitant to pop the hood, crawl underneath, and grab what I need from my stockpile of precision tools and spare parts. "Built not bought," was always my mantra and whenever I'm able to correct the problem, it only makes those cruises down the boulevards even sweeter.</p>
    			<p>I'm also an avid collector of vintage video games and have my own dream of one day opening up my own shop dedicated to the hobby. I spend a lot of my spare time searching online for people's unwanted consoles, games, and accessories with the hopes of adding the gems to my collection, or refurbishing whatever has found itself in a state of neglect over the years. Once I've given the collectable in question a healthy repair or cleaning I'll typically list it on Ebay so it can find its way into the hands of a new owner hoping to enjoy it for years to come. I've often considered these games an art form and very much appreciate all the work and creativy that goes into them and being able to keep these pieces of history alive and well for future generations to enjoy definitely gives me a very rewarding feeling.</p>
    		<h3>My Goals for the Future</h3>
    			<p>Over the last year and a half I've learned that I have an affinity for coding and programming! While in the past my creativity and problem-solving skills were usually allocated to automotives or fine arts, I've found that they can really come in handy when I'm working out how to make ideas come to life through the web. My goals for the future are to hone my skills and find a career doing something I really enjoy and find very fullfilling. It will be a challenge, but I'm excited to see just how far I can go with it.</p>
